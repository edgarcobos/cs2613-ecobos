<h2 id="hash-tables">Hash tables</h2>

<p>During lab 6, we learned about hash tables, which are similar to lists, but have an additional feature: fast key base retrieval of information. We learned that the function <code>hash</code> creates immutable hash tables, whose values can be retrieved through the <code>hash-ref</code> function. In addition to these two functions, there is one more function, <code>hash-set</code>, that will update the hash table pretty fast as we learned by looking at the ht2 function. We practiced using this last function to count the times a given element occurs in a list and learned about <code>car</code>, which is like <code>first</code>, but works for both lists and pairs.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Personally, I was already somehow familiar with the concept of hash tables from learning Swift that has a similar data structure called Enums.</li></ul>

<h2 id="plotting">Plotting</h2>

<p>Next, in order to play some more with the code from the calculus.rkt file from the previous lab, we added a provide statement to provide the definitions of 2pi, &ndash;2pi, and deriv. Then, we were able to compile and run the code from <strong>plot-example.rkt</strong>, which used the plot function to graph the functions resulting from the calculations in <strong>calculus.rkt</strong>. We also added a second call to plot to plot the difference between <code>(deriv sin x)</code> and <code>(cos x)</code>, finding out that we can modify the precision of our plot. I found this racket function very interesting as it allows you to plot different mathematical functions.</p>

<h2 id="json">JSON</h2>

<p>Our last taks was to write a function <strong>collect-status</strong> to collect the status values from errors.json to be inserted into a hash table and viewed in the exlporer window. By implementing this function, we practiced some more using <code>map</code> and <code>hash-ref</code>. I found the data explorer tool useful, especially for debugging as it allows you to check if data has been properly read-in and stored. By the end of this lab, I can say that I have become more familiar to the the DrRacket IDE, which is a positive outcome.</p>

<h2 id="tail-recursion">Tail Recursion</h2>

<p>For Part 1, the task was to use the debugger to run the code for the <strong>odds-evens</strong> function. The purpose of this function is to count the number of odd and even numbers in a list. As we observed the stack in the debugger, it became clear that the function was not tail recursive, which implies the results of the recursive calls are processed further before returning.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we completed the function <strong>odds-evens2</strong>, whose call to helper removes the first item of the list with ever call. It also increments either the odds or the evens argument by one, which represents a common pattern of replacing mutation with recursion. In order to test the stack usage of the function, we again used the debugger, this time, observing that the stack for this tail recursive function never got as deep as the one for the first implementation. Additionally, we were able to conclude that tail recursion is much more effecient in terms of stack since the calls to the helper function don&rsquo;t remain in the stack for very long.</p>

<h2 id="for-loops">For Loops</h2>

<p>In the following section, we learned about one Racket library form that allows to accumulate values. This form is called for/fold and it acts as a for loop. We looked at the function <strong>odds-evens3</strong> that implemented this form by setting an accumulator with an initial value of 0 for both the evens and the odds count. This function would loop over each element of a given list and, depending on whether it&rsquo;s even or odd, it would add one to either count. Finally, we looked into time comparison between the three different odds-evens implementations, concluding that the tail recursive function was the fastest one.</p>

<h2 id="racket-review">Racket Review</h2>

<p>New functions:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p><code>range</code></p></li>
 <li>
  <p><code>time</code></p></li></ul>

<p>New forms:</p>

<ul>

<p>New concepts</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>tail recursion</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>accumulator</p></li></ul>

<h2 id="numerical-integration">Numerical Integration</h2>

<p>In the last section of the lab, we practicing some more with tail recursion, and for loops and higher order functions by playing with derivative and integral calculation. Also, we explored unit tests even further, learning about the use of <code>check-=</code> for cases where there is a margin of error. This is a useful tool for when it comes to dealing with numbers with very high precision.</p>

<p>At the beginning of Lab 4, we discussed the similarities and differences between racket and Java. First, we looked at #lang racket and #lang slideshow which are the equivalent to import statements in Java. We also looked at (+ 1 2) which calls the function + and passes it two numbers to be added together. In Java, you don&rsquo;t need to make a funciton call to add and rather just add like so: 1 + 2. As we moved on to (rectangle 10 10), which in Java would be something like new Rectangle(10 10), we were able to identify a difference between racket and java, which is that racket allows printing picure values while Java does not. Next, (define r 10) is very similar to "int r = 10&rsquo; with the main difference being that in racket we don&rsquo;t need to specify what type of variable r is. The function (define (square x) (rectangle x x)) can be compared to having a Rectangle class and a Square class, whose constructor method initializes a Rectangle of same sides by passing the specified length as both arguments. The colorize function used as in (colorize (square 10) "red") would have no effect in Java as picture values don&rsquo;t exist but again the concept of calling a function with two parameters is the same. Lastly, the binding (let* ([x 10] [y (+ x 10)]) (* x y)) would be equivalent to writing &rsquo;int x = 10; int y = x + 10; return x*y;&rsquo; in Java, with no major difference. Afterwards, I learned about the build-list function, which basically creates a list of elements of a specified length and applies a specified procedure to them. Then, we practiced some more recursion and I noticed that it took me less time to solve the excercises than previously. Also, I followed along the Scribble Demo and created a new blog entry, implemented racket definitions for hello, greet and todo and their invocations can be found at the bottom of this post. Finally, we further explored modules, submodules, require, and provide by creating a module- with a test submodule and a main submodule- that acted as a library through require and provide.</p>

<p>In Lab 3 of the Programming Languages Lab, the main focus was to start using the Racket programming language. Specifically, we reviewed recursion -a concept I was already familiar from Introduction to Computer Programming II- and the racket syntax. The first function that we looked at was the my-map function, which basically takes a list of elements and passes them into a function that puts the output into a new list. We took this code and repurposed it to make a new function that takes an object, suppose a circle, and colors each element with a different color of the rainbow in a recursive manner. Understanding racket took a bit of time, but at the end of this lab, I feel more comfortable with its syntax and implementing basic recursive functions. Once we covered recursive functions we moved on to test submodules. For this, we used two functions for adding and multiplying from Dr. Bremener’s site. After adding test submodule with tests, we observed that the multiplication test failed, so our task was to fix the multiplication function. My solution was changing the base cases to return 0 if a is equal to 0 and return b if a is equal to 1 and else call the multiplication function again with (sub1 a) and b and add b to the result using the addition function already provided. When I ran the program, I finally observed no output from the tests, which meant success. Then, I enabled syntatic suit coverage in drracket and added 1 additional test for when a is equal to 0. Once I had complete test coverage, I commited the changes to git and pushed it to coursegit.</p>

<p>In lab 2, I learned about several new concepts related to the Racket programming language, including: Definitions, Local Binding, Lexical Scope, Lists, and Modules. As a warm-up, I created a program that printed &ldquo;hello world&rdquo;. After this, I started DrRacket and set it up by inserting #lang slideshow into the definitions area (top text area) to load some picture functions. By this point, I was ready to type some expressions into the interactions area (bottom text area), for DrRacket to evaluate and print their result. I evaluated function calls, such as the circle and the rectangle function that print a picture value of a specified size, which I found pretty interesting. Then, I learned about one last function, called hc-append, which basically combines pictures horizontally, and centers them vertically. Next, I learned about Definitions and added a function that printed a filled-rectange with equal sides of a specified length. Moreover, I learned about Local Binding and used the define form inside a function body to horizontally combine two pictures and be able to use this definition to vertically combine its results, creating a simple local binding. Additionally, I learned about two more forms of local binding: the let form that binds many identifiers at the same time, and the let* form that allows later bindings to use earlier bindings. By the end of this lab, I understand that Racket is a lexally scoped language, which means that whenever an identifier is used as an expression, something in the textual scope of the expression determines the identifier&rsquo;s binding. Also, I understand the list function as well as the map function that takes a list and a function to apply to each element of the list. Finally, I understand Modules and how to import additional libraries by using the require form.</p>

<p>For Lab 1, first we formed a group of 4 and completed the Hello Computer excercise as a warm-up. As part of the warm-up, we had to start the VM, start a terminal and practice making a directory, creating a file in that directory, and cleaning up. Next, this time individiaully, I followed the Frog Tutorial from the course outline to create a frog project under the cs2613 directory I had just created. I also started the new blog page for this journal entry, removing the previous fake entry created by the frog setup command. Then, I refreshed the browser running raco flag -bp to make sure everything was working properly. Moreover, I read Section 1.3 from Pro Git and revised the fundamentals of version control with Git. This included learning about the three states that files can reside in: modified, staged, and commited, and the three main sections of a Git project: working directory, staging area and .git directory (repository). I created the Git repository and configured my name, email and the editor, used git add, to add the journal folder and then used git commit to run my Initial commit. In order to get some hints about writing good commit messages, I read the Commit Guidelines from 5.2 of Pro Git. Finally, I added the remote repository so that I can push this blog to it.</p>
