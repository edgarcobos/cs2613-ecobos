## Representing a Graph

*What is const?*
Const is a way of creating an immutable variable. This means that a variable declared using cons will never change.

At the beginning of lab 11, we practiced creating a graph representation of a town using objects. For this, we created an object with places as keys and a list of neighbours as values. When creating the test cases for the routes, we used objectContaining() to check that the list of places adjacent to "Alice's House" contained "Bob's House".

These are the test cases:

``` js
it("Alice's neighbours",
function () {
        expect(roadGraph["Alice's House"].sort()).toEqual(["Bob's House", "Cabin", "Post Office"]);
        });
it("Bob's neighbours",
function () {
        expect(roadGraph["Bob's House"]).toEqual(jasmine.objectContaining(["Alice's House"]));
});
```

## Representing State


*What property of the VillageState data stucture is emphasized in this section of the book?*
The property of the VillageState data structure emphasizes is the parcel property.

*What "update" operation(s) in Racket does this remind you of?*
The "update" operation reminds me of `set` in Racket.

Next, we went over classes. We looked at the VillageState class with the function `move`. This function moves a parcel from the current place to a new one if the path is valid. It would also drop off any packages in their destination. Then, we converted code that logged **next.place**, **next.parcels**, and **first.place** into the console and used it to write our unit tests:

``` js
let first = new VillageState(
    "Post Office",
    [{place: "Post Office", address: "Alice's House"}, {place: "Mars", address: "Jupiter"}]
);
let next = first.move("Alice's House");
it("move changes place",
function () {
    expect(next.place).toEqual("Alice's House");
});
it("parcel is delivered",
function () {
    expect(next.parcels).toEqual([{place: "Mars", address: "Jupiter"}]);
});
it("move does not modify",
function () {
    expect(first.place).toEqual("Post Office");
});
```

## Testing the random robot

The last section, we explored mock tests by using the `spy` utility to help us intercept calls to a function and record what they are called with. For this, we used the `runRobot` function that is used to deliver packages through `randomPick` and `randomRobot`. Then, we intercepted the calls made to `console.log` to check if it was called with the correct string and, thus, we were able to determine the success of `runRobot`.

Mock tests using `spy`:

``` js
it("no parcels",
    function() {
    console.log = jasmine.createSpy("log");
    let noParcels = new VillageState("Post Office",[]);
    village.runRobot(noParcels);
    expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Done in 0 turns");
});
it("randomRobot",
    function() {
    console.log = jasmine.createSpy("log");
    village.runRobot(VillageState.random(), village.randomRobot);
    expect(console.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith(jasmine.stringMatching(/^Done/));
});
```
