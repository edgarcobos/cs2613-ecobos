##  First Example

In lab 14, we started looking at the Python programming language. The first excercise required us to download the file `humansize.py` and run it from the command line and in vscodium with the debugger. We also evaluated some expressions using the bottom prompt of the debugguer window in vscodium as well as by running `python3` in the terminal, which is the equivalent of evaluating expressions in the interactions area in DrRacket.

## Pytest

Next, we practiced writing unit tests using pytest. As an excercise, we downloaded the file `test_humansize.py` and ran it with `pytest-3` in the terminal. We also converted working examples from **DiP3 1.2.1** and learned to run the tests from within vscodium.

## Modules

Then, we went over modules in Python, for which we imported humansize in `client.py` to call its `approximate_size` function. We also learned that code from a module guarded by `if __name__ == '__main__'` does not run when importing the module.

Calling a function from the module looks like this:

``` py
from humansize import approximate_size

approximate_size(4000, a_kilobyte_is_1024_bytes=False)
```

## More testing, docstrings

In this part of the lab, we created `test_client.py` and added tests to make sure that the new function has a docstring by accessing it like so: `approximate_size.__doc__` and that it makes sense.

## Indentation

Afterwards, we learned about Python's surprising use of indentation to define blocks by fixing the indentation in `fizzbuzz.py` and add the missing case for Fizz to solve the FizzBuzz problem.

The corrected version of `fizzbuzz.py` looks like this:

``` py
for i in range(1,101):
    if (i%3 == 0 and i%5 == 0):
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif (i%3==0):
        print("Fizz")
    elif (i%5 == 0):
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
```

## Exceptions

In the last section, we modified `divisive.py` so that it would pass the provided tests and my solution ended up looking like this:

``` py
def fraction(a,b):
    if(b != 0):
        return a/b
    else:
        return "NaN"
```
