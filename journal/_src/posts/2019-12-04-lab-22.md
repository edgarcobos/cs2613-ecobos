## Cell Arrays

At the beginning of the lab, we learned about cell arrays, which are like multidimensional versions of Python's lists. Our task was to change the following example to find the columns sums in a function `rowfun`.

``` matlab
data = [0,0,0; 0,0,1; 0,1,0; 1,1,1]
cells = num2cell(data,2)
cellfun(@sum,cells)
```

## Variable-length argument lists

Next, we practiced using `varargin` to update the `timeit` function from Lab 20 for it tow work not only for single argument functions. This special input argument `varargin` collects all remaining arguments into a cell array, similar to rest in Racket.

## K nearest neighbour

In this part of the lab, we looked at the k-Nearest neighbour algorithm. Our task was to complete the `nearest` function which returns the row indices of the `k` closest rows of `data` to `v` with the help of the distance definition from linear algebra (`distance(X,Y) = norm(X-Y`). Then, we timed our nearest neighbour query with the following:

``` matlab
load training
load testing
timeit(1000,@nearest,testing(1,:), 3, training);
```

## Using rowfun

Lastly, we used the `find` function to complete the loop-free version of knn, which is a useful technique to know in general.
