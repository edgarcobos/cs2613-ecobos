## Broadcasting

At the beginning of this lab, we learned about broadcasting. The rule for broadcasting is that corresponding array dimensions must either be equal, or one of them must be 1. In the case where one of the dimensions is 1, the smaller matrix is tiled to match the dimensions of the larger matrix. This can be demonstrated with the following example:

``` matlab
x = [1 2 3;
     4 5 6;
     7 8 9];
y = [10 20 30];
x + y
```

``` matlab
ans =

11   22   33
14   25   36
17   28   39
```

## Scaling layers of arrays

In this part of the lab, we completed the `scale_layers` function like so:

``` matlab
function out = scale_layers(array, weights)
    out = array .* reshape(weights,[1,1,3]);
endfunction
```

We converted  `paris.jpg` to sepia by running the folowing demo code:

``` matlab
paris=imread("paris.jpg");
sepia=scale_layers(paris,[0.9,0.62,0.34]);
imshow(sepia);
```

## Monochrome

After converting to sepia, we practiced converting images to monochrome by completing the `monochrome` function as follows:

``` matlab
function out = monochrome(in, weights=[0.21,0.72,0.07])
    out = sum(scale_layers(in,weights),3)
endfunction
```

## Gradient

Lastly, we completed the `normgrad` function by combining Dx and Dy arrays into a single array such that `norming(i,j) = norm([Dx(i,j),Dy(i,j)])`.

``` matlab
function normimg = normgrad(img)
    [Dx, Dy] = gradient(img);
    normimg = sqrt(Dx.^2 + Dy.^2);
endfunction
```
