## Running Octave

At the beginning of Lab 20, we practiced running Octave. Similar to Racket, there are two main ways to run it; through a REPL by running  `octave` in the command line, or through a GUI application.

## Fibonacci

Next, we looked at creating an Octave program to generate a Fibonacci sequence. Some of the noticeable differences between Octave and other programming languages is define scope, done in Octave by using keywords such as `endfor` and `endfunction`. This is how the Octave version of the Fibonacci generator ended up looking like:

``` matlab
function ret = fib(n)
    a = 0;
    b = 1;
    for i=0:n
        ret = a;
        a = a + b;
        b = ret;
    endfor
endfunction
```

## Matrix and vector review

* `Dot product: dot([1;0;1], [2,1,0])`
* `Matrix multiplication: [1;0;1] * [2,1,0]`

## Fibonacci as matrix multiplication

After the matrix and vector review, we practiced using matrices to calculate the Fibonacci sequence.

```matlab
function ret = fibmat(n)
    A = [1,1; 1,0];
    B = A^n;
    ret = B(1,2);
endfunction
```

## Performance comparison

fib     median=0.209ms mean=0.217ms total=21741.440ms
fibmat  median=0.037ms mean=0.039ms total=3910.122ms

Vectorization is about 5 times faster than iteration.

## Using the profiler

Lastly, we looked at profiling, which improves upon timing by recording the number of calls to each function

Through the profiler, we were able to observe that the iterative version makes 1001 calls to the binary + operator compared to the one call made to the binary ^ in the vectorized implementation, which explains why the vectorized version is faster.
