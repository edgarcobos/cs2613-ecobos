<h2 id="javascript-equallity-and-type-coercion">JavaScript equallity and type coercion</h2>

<p>At the beginning of lab 9, we learned about equality and type coercion in JavaScript. We tried out the standard equality test <code>==</code>, which converts the operands if they are not of the same type before applying strict comparison. I also read that, if both operands are objects, then JavaScript compares internal references wich are equal when operands refer to the same object in memory. In addition, we tried out the &ldquo;strict equality&rdquo; checker <code>===</code>, which returns true if the operands are strictly equal with no type conversion. In order to avoid the twisty maze of &ldquo;helpful&rdquo; type coercion, it is suggested to use the strict equality checker.</p>

<h2 id="javascript-functions">JavaScript functions</h2>

<p>Next, we went over the two ways of defining functions in JavaScript:</p>

<ol>
 <li>By assigning an anonymous function to a variable</li>
 <li>Through the binding and creation of a function</li></ol>

<div class="brush: js">
 <table class="sourcetable">

</div>

<p>Answers from part 3:</p>

<ul>
 <li><code>Assignment (=) in Racket is different from binding (let, define) because assignment changes a value whereas binding creates an immutable variable.</code></li>
 <li>`<code>return</code> is mandatory in order to tell our program when a function has end and what value to return as opposed to racket.`</li>
 <li><code>arrow function vs regular function</code>
  <ul>
   <li><code>arrow functions do not have their own this</code></li>
   <li><code>arrow functions are onlly cannot be constructed using the new keyword</code></li>
   <li><code>argument objects are not available in arrow functions</code></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>Lastly, we looked over the recursive function <strong>plus</strong> and implemented <strong>mult</strong> based on it.</p>

<h2 id="nodejs-modules">Node.js modules</h2>

<p>In this part, we took our functions from the previous excercise and exported them like so: <code>exports.plus = plus;</code>. In a new file <code>client.js</code> we required and used them like so: <code>let arith=require("./loop-arith.js"); console.log(arith.plus(2,2));</code>.</p>

<h2 id="jasmine">Jasmine</h2>

<p>Then, we learned about a popular unit testing framework for JavaScript called Jasmine. We made a test submodule that required the code from loop-arith and filled in the missing pieces from <strong>loop-arith.spec.js</strong> to make a passing test suite. In order to get test coverage information, we ran jasmine via another tool called nyc like so: <code>nyc jasmine</code>.</p>

<h2 id="recursion-in-javascript">Recursion in JavaScript</h2>

<p>Finally, we filled in the recursive defintion of <strong>mult</strong> for <strong>loop-arith2.js</strong> using <strong>plus</strong> based on the racket solution. We, then, made two test suites, one to test <strong>loop-arith2.js</strong> and another one to test <strong>loop-arith.js</strong> against <strong>loop-arith2.js</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="running-javascript">Running JavaScript</h2>

<p>At the start of lab 7 we created a new file, added some JavaScripct code, started debugging, and commmited, all in VSCodium.</p>

<h2 id="translating-racket-expressions-into-javascript">Translating Racket expressions into Javascript</h2>

<p>Since our focus was to transition from Racket into Javascript, our first task involved filling in the JavaScript expressions equivalent to Racket expressions that were given to us. This expressions can be found in the file expr.js and they involve Racket procedures such as <code>string-append</code> and <code>equal?</code>.</p>

<h2 id="looping">Looping</h2>

<p>Our next two tasks involved loops, more specifically, for loops. The first one was to write a loop to generate the following output:</p>

<p><code>#</code>
 <br /><code>##</code>
 <br /><code>###</code>
 <br /><code>####</code>
 <br /><code>#####</code>
 <br /><code>######</code>
 <br /><code>#######</code></p>

<p>My solution initially looped from 0 to 6, priting one <code>#</code> the first time and added one more <code>#</code> to be printed during the next iteration. However, after I followed along the talk by <em>Gary Bernhardt</em>, I decided to print Array(i).join ("#") and looped from 2 to 8. This solution was a bit shorter than the previous one and it allowed me to explore another feature of javascript.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we discussed about three &ldquo;special numbers&rdquo; in JavaScript: NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity and looked for arithmetic expressions that yield these three special numbers. Additionally we talked about <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code> variables.</p>

<p>Lastly, we solved the famous <strong>FizzBuzz</strong> problem, which is essentially some nested ifs inside a for loop. I tried both the obvious solution and the tricky one hinted at in the text without encountering any difficulty.</p>

<h2 id="macros">Macros</h2>

<p>The first task of lab 7 was to define syntax rules for the boolean logic operations <strong>and</strong> and <strong>or</strong>. For this, we defined <strong>And</strong> so that it would make an evaluation between two arguments like the lower case version <strong>and</strong> would, except the short-circuit evaluation would be done from the right. We looked over a test submodule with <code>check-exn</code> that takes a <em>thunk</em> as an argument, or, as we learned, a function with zero paramters. In this case, lambda was used to delay evaluation in <code>check-exn</code> and it was pointed out that such boilerplate could be avoid with a syntax rule.</p>

<p>Our next task was to define <strong>Or</strong> in a similar way to <strong>And</strong> and test it out. I found this short-circuit evaluation relatively easy to implement and I considered it a good review of <em>Discrete Structures</em> and operations using boolean logic.</p>

<h2 id="pattern-matching">Pattern Matching</h2>

<p>We learned a new useful feature of racket called <em>pattern matching</em> as used in <code>syntax-case</code> and function definitions using <code>match</code>, which specifies a pattern to match against the data. We looked over an implementation of the function <code>my-map</code> that used <code>match</code> and compared it to its original implementation that used <code>cond</code>, helping us understand the application of <code>match</code>. Additionaly, we used the &hellip; &ldquo;collector pattern&rdquo; as it is a common racket idiom. Then, we were instructed to implement let* in terms of let using a macro for which we had to complete the skeleton for the let-transformer module.</p>

<h2 id="from-list-transformers-to-macros">From list transformers to macros</h2>

<p>Finally, we used <code>syntax-case</code> in a similar way to how we used <code>match</code>, but this time to define the macro <strong>Let^</strong>. Using <code>syntax-case</code> eliminated the need to write a separate transformer. The patterns for this statement are analogous to match so our task only required to reverse engineer them.</p>

<h2 id="hash-tables">Hash tables</h2>

<p>During lab 6, we learned about hash tables, which are similar to lists, but have an additional feature: fast key base retrieval of information. We learned that the function <code>hash</code> creates immutable hash tables, whose values can be retrieved through the <code>hash-ref</code> function. In addition to these two functions, there is one more function, <code>hash-set</code>, that will update the hash table pretty fast as we learned by looking at the ht2 function. We practiced using this last function to count the times a given element occurs in a list and learned about <code>car</code>, which is like <code>first</code>, but works for both lists and pairs.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Personally, I was already somehow familiar with the concept of hash tables from learning Swift that has a similar data structure called Enums.</li></ul>

<h2 id="plotting">Plotting</h2>

<p>Next, in order to play some more with the code from the calculus.rkt file from the previous lab, we added a provide statement to provide the definitions of 2pi, &ndash;2pi, and deriv. Then, we were able to compile and run the code from <strong>plot-example.rkt</strong>, which used the plot function to graph the functions resulting from the calculations in <strong>calculus.rkt</strong>. We also added a second call to plot to plot the difference between <code>(deriv sin x)</code> and <code>(cos x)</code>, finding out that we can modify the precision of our plot. I found this racket function very interesting as it allows you to plot different mathematical functions.</p>

<h2 id="json">JSON</h2>

<p>Our last taks was to write a function <strong>collect-status</strong> to collect the status values from errors.json to be inserted into a hash table and viewed in the exlporer window. By implementing this function, we practiced some more using <code>map</code> and <code>hash-ref</code>. I found the data explorer tool useful, especially for debugging as it allows you to check if data has been properly read-in and stored. By the end of this lab, I can say that I have become more familiar to the the DrRacket IDE, which is a positive outcome.</p>

<h2 id="tail-recursion">Tail Recursion</h2>

<p>For Part 1, the task was to use the debugger to run the code for the <strong>odds-evens</strong> function. The purpose of this function is to count the number of odd and even numbers in a list. As we observed the stack in the debugger, it became clear that the function was not tail recursive, which implies the results of the recursive calls are processed further before returning.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we completed the function <strong>odds-evens2</strong>, whose call to helper removes the first item of the list with ever call. It also increments either the odds or the evens argument by one, which represents a common pattern of replacing mutation with recursion. In order to test the stack usage of the function, we again used the debugger, this time, observing that the stack for this tail recursive function never got as deep as the one for the first implementation. Additionally, we were able to conclude that tail recursion is much more effecient in terms of stack since the calls to the helper function don&rsquo;t remain in the stack for very long.</p>

<h2 id="for-loops">For Loops</h2>

<p>In the following section, we learned about one Racket library form that allows to accumulate values. This form is called for/fold and it acts as a for loop. We looked at the function <strong>odds-evens3</strong> that implemented this form by setting an accumulator with an initial value of 0 for both the evens and the odds count. This function would loop over each element of a given list and, depending on whether it&rsquo;s even or odd, it would add one to either count. Finally, we looked into time comparison between the three different odds-evens implementations, concluding that the tail recursive function was the fastest one.</p>

<h2 id="numerical-integration">Numerical Integration</h2>

<p>In the last section of the lab, we practicing some more with tail recursion, and for loops and higher order functions by playing with derivative and integral calculation. Also, we explored unit tests even further, learning about the use of <code>check-=</code> for cases where there is a margin of error. This is a useful tool for when it comes to dealing with numbers with very high precision.</p>

<p>At the beginning of Lab 4, we discussed the similarities and differences between racket and Java. First, we looked at #lang racket and #lang slideshow which are the equivalent to import statements in Java. We also looked at (+ 1 2) which calls the function + and passes it two numbers to be added together. In Java, you don&rsquo;t need to make a funciton call to add and rather just add like so: 1 + 2. As we moved on to (rectangle 10 10), which in Java would be something like new Rectangle(10 10), we were able to identify a difference between racket and java, which is that racket allows printing picure values while Java does not. Next, (define r 10) is very similar to "int r = 10&rsquo; with the main difference being that in racket we don&rsquo;t need to specify what type of variable r is. The function (define (square x) (rectangle x x)) can be compared to having a Rectangle class and a Square class, whose constructor method initializes a Rectangle of same sides by passing the specified length as both arguments. The colorize function used as in (colorize (square 10) "red") would have no effect in Java as picture values don&rsquo;t exist but again the concept of calling a function with two parameters is the same. Lastly, the binding (let* ([x 10] [y (+ x 10)]) (* x y)) would be equivalent to writing &rsquo;int x = 10; int y = x + 10; return x*y;&rsquo; in Java, with no major difference. Afterwards, I learned about the build-list function, which basically creates a list of elements of a specified length and applies a specified procedure to them. Then, we practiced some more recursion and I noticed that it took me less time to solve the excercises than previously. Also, I followed along the Scribble Demo and created a new blog entry, implemented racket definitions for hello, greet and todo and their invocations can be found at the bottom of this post. Finally, we further explored modules, submodules, require, and provide by creating a module- with a test submodule and a main submodule- that acted as a library through require and provide.</p>

<p>In Lab 3 of the Programming Languages Lab, the main focus was to start using the Racket programming language. Specifically, we reviewed recursion -a concept I was already familiar from Introduction to Computer Programming II- and the racket syntax. The first function that we looked at was the my-map function, which basically takes a list of elements and passes them into a function that puts the output into a new list. We took this code and repurposed it to make a new function that takes an object, suppose a circle, and colors each element with a different color of the rainbow in a recursive manner. Understanding racket took a bit of time, but at the end of this lab, I feel more comfortable with its syntax and implementing basic recursive functions. Once we covered recursive functions we moved on to test submodules. For this, we used two functions for adding and multiplying from Dr. Bremener’s site. After adding test submodule with tests, we observed that the multiplication test failed, so our task was to fix the multiplication function. My solution was changing the base cases to return 0 if a is equal to 0 and return b if a is equal to 1 and else call the multiplication function again with (sub1 a) and b and add b to the result using the addition function already provided. When I ran the program, I finally observed no output from the tests, which meant success. Then, I enabled syntatic suit coverage in drracket and added 1 additional test for when a is equal to 0. Once I had complete test coverage, I commited the changes to git and pushed it to coursegit.</p>

<p>In lab 2, I learned about several new concepts related to the Racket programming language, including: Definitions, Local Binding, Lexical Scope, Lists, and Modules. As a warm-up, I created a program that printed &ldquo;hello world&rdquo;. After this, I started DrRacket and set it up by inserting #lang slideshow into the definitions area (top text area) to load some picture functions. By this point, I was ready to type some expressions into the interactions area (bottom text area), for DrRacket to evaluate and print their result. I evaluated function calls, such as the circle and the rectangle function that print a picture value of a specified size, which I found pretty interesting. Then, I learned about one last function, called hc-append, which basically combines pictures horizontally, and centers them vertically. Next, I learned about Definitions and added a function that printed a filled-rectange with equal sides of a specified length. Moreover, I learned about Local Binding and used the define form inside a function body to horizontally combine two pictures and be able to use this definition to vertically combine its results, creating a simple local binding. Additionally, I learned about two more forms of local binding: the let form that binds many identifiers at the same time, and the let* form that allows later bindings to use earlier bindings. By the end of this lab, I understand that Racket is a lexally scoped language, which means that whenever an identifier is used as an expression, something in the textual scope of the expression determines the identifier&rsquo;s binding. Also, I understand the list function as well as the map function that takes a list and a function to apply to each element of the list. Finally, I understand Modules and how to import additional libraries by using the require form.</p>

<p>For Lab 1, first we formed a group of 4 and completed the Hello Computer excercise as a warm-up. As part of the warm-up, we had to start the VM, start a terminal and practice making a directory, creating a file in that directory, and cleaning up. Next, this time individiaully, I followed the Frog Tutorial from the course outline to create a frog project under the cs2613 directory I had just created. I also started the new blog page for this journal entry, removing the previous fake entry created by the frog setup command. Then, I refreshed the browser running raco flag -bp to make sure everything was working properly. Moreover, I read Section 1.3 from Pro Git and revised the fundamentals of version control with Git. This included learning about the three states that files can reside in: modified, staged, and commited, and the three main sections of a Git project: working directory, staging area and .git directory (repository). I created the Git repository and configured my name, email and the editor, used git add, to add the journal folder and then used git commit to run my Initial commit. In order to get some hints about writing good commit messages, I read the Commit Guidelines from 5.2 of Pro Git. Finally, I added the remote repository so that I can push this blog to it.</p>
