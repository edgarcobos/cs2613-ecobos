First, we looked at #lang racket and #lang slideshow which are the equivalent to import statements in Java. We also looked at (+ 1 2) which calls the function + and passes it two numbers to be added together. In Java, you don&rsquo;t need to make a funciton call to add and rather just add like so: 1 + 2. As we moved on to (rectangle 10 10), which in Java would be something like new Rectangle(10 10), we were able to identify a difference between racket and java, which is that racket allows printing picure values while Java does not. Next, (define r 10) is very similar to \"int r = 10&rsquo; with the main difference being that in racket we don&rsquo;t need to specify what type of variable r is.

"\n<p>At the beginning of Lab 4, we discussed the similarities and differences between racket and Java. First, we looked at #lang racket and #lang slideshow which are the equivalent to import statements in Java. We also looked at (+ 1 2) which calls the function + and passes it two numbers to be added together. In Java, you don&rsquo;t need to make a funciton call to add and rather just add like so: 1 + 2. As we moved on to (rectangle 10 10), which in Java would be something like new Rectangle(10 10), we were able to identify a difference between racket and java, which is that racket allows printing picure values while Java does not. Next, (define r 10) is very similar to \"int r = 10&rsquo; with the main difference being that in racket we don&rsquo;t need to specify what type of variable r is. The function (define (square x) (rectangle x x)) can be compared to having a Rectangle class and a Square class, whose constructor method initializes a Rectangle of same sides by passing the specified length as both arguments.

We looked at the <code>setTimout</code> function which takes in a callback function and an amount of time to wait before calling the function. This imitates a sleep function with some drawbacks. Since JavaScript runs asynchronously it will run code that is sequentially after the <code>setTimeout</code> call, which may produce an error linked to order of operations. In this case, <code>setTimeout</code> was used in a function to print out an increasing number of <code>*</code>, imitating a progress bar, which looked like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: js\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">loop</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"nx\">str</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"\\033c\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n        <span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">str</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n        <span class=\"nx\">setTimeout</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"nx\">loop</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">str</span><span class=\"o\">+</span><span class=\"s2\">\"*\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span> <span class=\"p\">},</span> <span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">else</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"all done!\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">loop</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"s2\">\"*\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</div>\n\n<p>After implementing our progress bar using the <code>setTimeout</code> function, we were introduced to <code>setInterval</code> and <code>clearInterval</code> that have the purpose to set up a recurring timer to call a function after a specified amount of time. In this case, the functions were used to again produce our own progress bar with a 300ms interaval before each additional <code>*</code>. Once the desired number of iterations was reached, the function printed &ldquo;all done!&rdquo; and cleared the interval.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: js\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n

"\n<h2 id=\"timers\">Timers</h2>\n\n<p>At the beginning of Lab 13, we went over asynchronous programming in JavaScript. We looked at the <code>setTimout</code> function which takes in a callback function and an amount of time to wait before calling the function. This imitates a sleep function with some drawbacks. Since JavaScript runs asynchronously it will run code that is sequentially after the <code>setTimeout</code> call, which may produce an error linked to order of operations. In this case, <code>setTimeout</code> was used in a function to print out an increasing number of <code>*</code>, imitating a progress bar, which looked like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: js\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span></span><span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">loop</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"nx\">str</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"\\033c\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n        <span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">str</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n        <span class=\"nx\">setTimeout</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"nx\">loop</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">i</span><span class=\"o\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nx\">str</span><span class=\"o\">+</span><span class=\"s2\">\"*\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span> <span class=\"p\">},</span> <span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">else</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"all done!\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">loop</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"s2\">\"*\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</div>\n\n<p>After implementing our progress bar using the <code>setTimeout</code> function, we were introduced to <code>setInterval</code> and <code>clearInterval</code> that have the purpose to set up a recurring timer to call a function after a specified amount of time. In this case, the functions were used to again produce our own progress bar with a 300ms interaval before each additional <code>*</code>. Once the desired number of iterations was reached, the function printed &ldquo;all done!&rdquo; and cleared the interval.</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: js\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n
